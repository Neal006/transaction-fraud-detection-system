# Enhanced Fraud Detection System

A comprehensive fraud detection system that combines machine learning models with contextual insights, real-time alerts, and interactive visualizations.

## Features

- **Advanced Fraud Detection**: Uses ensemble of machine learning models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks)
- **Contextual Insights**: Detailed analysis of contributing factors for each transaction
- **Real-time Alerts**: Email notifications for high-risk transactions
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring of fraud trends and system performance
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Built-in checks for regulatory concerns
- **Explainable AI**: LIME-based explanations for model predictions

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd fraud-detection-system
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure email alerts:
   - Update the SMTP configuration in `insights_and_alerts.py`
   - Set your email credentials and server details

## Usage

1. Prepare your transaction data in CSV format with the following columns:
   - TransactionID
   - TransactionDate
   - TransactionAmount
   - AccountID
   - CustomerAge
   - CustomerOccupation
   - TransactionType
   - Channel
   - Location
   - DeviceID
   - IP Address
   - MerchantID
   - AccountBalance
   - LoginAttempts
   - TransactionDuration
   - PreviousTransactionDate
   - is_fraud (optional, for training)

2. Run the fraud detection system:
```bash
python fraud_detection.py
```

3. Access the dashboard:
   - Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8050`
   - View real-time fraud trends and insights
